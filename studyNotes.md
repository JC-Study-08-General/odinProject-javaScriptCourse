# CSS
**CSS Functions** = calc, max, min & clamp [w3School-CSS Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_functions.php)

**CSS Frameworks** = Bootstrap & tailwind

**CSS Preprocessors** = SASS, LESS & Stylus

**SCreen Break Points** = for mobile friendly design should break at 500px, 1000px, 1200px

# Objects
**Constructor Objects** = What is the difference between class and a constructor?! in simple words a class is like a blueprint and defines the framework that other objects can inherit, a constructor is something that actually creates the object in the program whereas the class only gives the guidelines.

**ProtoTypes**

- **All objects have prototypes** = You can check the objectâ€™s prototype by using the Object.getPrototypeOf() function on the object, like Object.getPrototypeOf(player1).
- Created outside of the object and inherited.  This saves duplicating the prototype into every object created.
- created by objectName.prototype = object.create(nameOfPrototype.prototype)
- **Prototypal inheritance** = This kind of inheritance using prototypes is hence named as Prototypal inheritance. JavaScript figures out which properties exist (or do not exist) on the object and starts traversing the chain to find the property or function.
