# Objects
**Constructor Objects** = What is the difference between class and a constructor?! in simple words a class is like a blueprint and defines the framework that other objects can inherit, a constructor is something that actually creates the object in the program whereas the class only gives the guidelines.

**ProtoTypes**

- Created outside of the object and inherited.  This saves duplicating the prototype into every object created.
- created by objectName.prototype = object.create(nameOfPrototype.prototype)
